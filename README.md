# GPSPostQuantum

This repository implements the [Galbraith--Petit--Silva](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1154.pdf) quantum-resistant cryptosystem, introduced in ASIACRYPT 2017. It uses as a dependency the number-theory library LiDIA, in [a fork of which](https://github.com/benediamond/LiDIA/tree/f_q_support) I have added extended support for point-counting-related operations on curves over prime-power-order fields. As far as I know, it is the first implementation of this theoretically compelling post-quantum cryptosystem.

This is still a proof-of-concept, and not suitable (or practical, yet) for actual cryptographic use.

## Technical Notes

### Overview

My approach diverges in few respects from the original paper of GPS.

Most importantly, I never factor division polynomials during key- or signature-generation, either when conducting random isogeny walks or while reconstructing walks from their endomorphism-ring ideals.

In a "hybrid" approach inspired by the work of [De Feo--Jao--Plût](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/506.pdf), I pre-generate torsion bases for each of the prime-power factors which appear in the random-walk degree. Then, during walking, only random combinations of these fixed torsion bases must be generated. In particular, this pre-generation approach relegates the factorization of division polynomials, which is expensive, to a pre-processing step which need only be conducted once. Its results can be serialized to text, and then re-imported, for the fast reconstruction of a ready GPS signer--verifier object.

Interestingly, the factorization of division polynomials, whether during signing or preprocessing, could be avoided altogether using an Elkies-type algorithm; see issue [#1](https://github.com/benediamond/GPSPostQuantum/issues/1) for discussion on this.

### Performance and Parallelization

I have generated a GPS object for a "toy-sized" prime of 16 bits (resulting in 4 bits of post-quantum security), and dumped the resulting serialization to `serializations/l = 4, p = 67967.txt`.

Again inspired by De Feo--Jao--Plût, I chose `p = 67967` because of the low multiplicative order of `p` modulo the prime powers appearing in the degree of its resulting isogeny walk. The idea is that poor performance during key-generation and signing comes primarily from the high degrees of the extension fields over which certain particular prime powers' torsion generators reside. In particular, among those primes `p > 2^16`, 67967 minimizes the maximum of ord(p, l_i^{e_i}) as l_i^{e_i} ranges throughout the minimal set of prime powers for which adequate mixing in `p`'s isogeny graph is achieved (see GPS, Lemma 1). More precisely, we control the order of `-p` modulo each {1, ..., l_i^{e_i} - 1} / (x ~ -x), where the former is viewed as an automorphism, or rather bijection, of the latter via multiplication. This order constitutes an upper bound on the degree of any particular irreducible factor of the l_i^{e_i}th division polynomial.

Even this pre-generation step took some time---about a day's worth of work on a single thread of a MacBook Pro. However, there are ways that the construction of torsion bases could become vastly faster; see again issue [#1](https://github.com/benediamond/GPSPostQuantum/issues/1).

Beyond this theoretically grounded improvement, both preprocessing _and_ signing would benefit vastly from parallelization. See [#4](https://github.com/benediamond/GPSPostQuantum/issues/4) for more discussion on this. Put simply, parallelization would impose virtually no overhead, in the sense that with multiple cores would simply divide the total time correspondingly.

In particular, using even using the small `p = 67967`, signing takes an uncomfortable 7 minutes or so. This time could be divided, however, by however many parallel threads one had access to.

Verifying takes about 5 seconds, and uses the [modular polynomials database](https://math.mit.edu/~drew/ClassicalModPolys.html) of Andrew Sutherland, whom I thank. The relevant files (i.e., for each l_i^{e_i}) must placed in a top-level directory `/modular/`.

### Differences from Galbraith--Petit--Silva: Detail

I now describe the differences from the paper of GPS in more detail.

* As described above, I move torsion-basis-generation to a preprocessing step. During walking, for each l_i^{e_i}, only the coefficients of each Q_i with respect to the pre-computed l_i^{e_i}-torsion basis must be randomly generated.
* As a consequence of this, it is necessary, for the success of Algorithm 2, that the powersmooth norm S of the endormorphism ring ideal generated by Algorithm 1 be known in advance. Resultingly, it not possible to dynamically adjust the powersmooth numbers S_1 and S_2 as suggested in GPS, Algorithm 1. I therefore require that S_1 * S_2 equal the powersmooth norm S_1 * S_2 originally chosen. On the other hand, it is _not_ necessary, as appears to be implied by Algorithm 3, that these numbers _individually_ (at least at first) agree with their counterparts specified in section 4.5, but only that their product does. I therefore choose, in order to ensure that the right-hand sides of lines 11 and 18 be large enough, an "imbalanced" approach where S_2 is much larger than S_1 (_only in Algorithm 1, that is_).
* As another consequence, line 14 of Algorithm 1 can't go through as written. Instead, I keep regenerating _beta_1_ until the Legendre condition of line 14 is true immediately (that is, with r = 1).
* The "linear algebra modulo _N_" of line 13, described further in [Kohel, Lauter, Petit, and Tignol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/505.pdf), section 4.3, requires an isomorphism O/NO --> M_2(Z / NZ). An expression of -p as a sum of squares mod N, with the aid of which which this isomorphism can be computed (see Keith Conrad's [explainer](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/ringtheory/quaternionalg.pdf) on quaterion algebras, Theorem 4.16), is constructed most naturally when -1 is a square modulo N (see Theorem 4.14---but also cf. Corollary 4.24). I thus enforce in Algorithm 1, line 6 that N = 1 (mod 4).

There are more changes that I can't recall; I will try to add these as time goes on.

## Building and Usage Instructions

First, build and install the `f_q_support` branch of [my fork of LiDIA](https://github.com/benediamond/LiDIA/tree/f_q_support). Also install [crypto++](https://www.cryptopp.com/).

Once you've done this, GPS can be built using something like:
```bash
g++ main.cc walker.cc gps.cc extension.cc -isystem/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -o main -lLiDIA -lgmp -lm -lcryptopp -std="c++11" -O2
```
An example of usage is given in the file `main.cc`, which imports a GPS object from a file, generates a keypair, and signs and verifies a message. Here is an example output:
